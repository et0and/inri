    <p>According to the Oxford English Dictionary, subject matter means the topic dealt with or the subject represented in a debate, exposition, or work of art.</p>

    <p>So in a nutshell, subject matter could be described as what the work is about. It means what is the story behind the work that you are looking at, what is it depicting or dealing with?</p>

    <h3>An example - Michael Parekowhai</h3>
    <p>A dominant colour is one that is stronger than the other. For example, a bright orange would stand out against a background of grey concrete. You can use dominant colours to your advantage, making certain things pop-out from the rest of the image. But be careful! Choosing too many dominant colours can be confusing to the eye!</p>

    <p>Letâ€™s take this photograph by Michael Parekowhai as an example. At a basic level, you could say that the work is about flowers (because that is what you see in the image!)</p>
